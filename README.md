arbitrary LispyScript expressions into Javascript functions at run-time.

## A Javascript with Lispy syntax and Macros!
Lispyscript is Javascript using a 'Lispy' syntax, and compiles to Javascript.

## Features
* Javscript Semantics
* Macros
* Tail Call Optimization
* Templates
* Callback Sequence (avoid nested callbacks)
* Monads 
* Browser compatible 
* Unit test feature


#### LispyScript was inspired by [Beating the averages](http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html).
